project-carrot
==============
Project Carrot is a Jazz Jackrabbit 2 engine clone.

Building
--------
What's done so far has been written to be compatible with the following setup:
* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2013](http://www.visualstudio.com/)
* [Qt](http://qt-project.org/downloads) 5.3.0
* [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) 2.1
* [BASS](http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html) 2.4

The above also lists the three libraries required to build the project.

If you have problems getting your configuration to work, sorry, I'm not the guy to look for help.
I've never shared a project of this scale to someone else before. A good place to start from is
to make the library/include/etc. paths in the project configuration to point to where you saved
each library, though.

Running the game
----------------
You ***will*** need to contact me on the [Jazz2Online forums](http://www.jazz2online.com/jcf/)
if you actually want to run the game. To prevent getting into too much potential legal trouble
this early, all resources extracted from the original game are excluded from the repository and
the game will simply fail to run without them. Send the user Soulweaver at J2F a private message
with a sufficient proof of ownership (such as an image with a boxed copy and a paper with your
user name).
